In this exercise, your task involves working with SQL (Structured Query Language), which is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.

### Core Concepts Explained

#### 1. **Database and Tables:**
- **Database:** Think of a database as a digital filing cabinet that contains various documents. Each document represents a collection of related information.
- **Tables:** Within a database, data is organized in tables, much like a spreadsheet. Each table consists of rows (records) and columns (fields or attributes).

#### 2. **SQL SELECT Statement:**
- **Purpose:** The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from a database. It allows you to specify which data you want to see.
- **Syntax Breakdown:**
  - `SELECT`: This keyword indicates that you want to read data.
  - `*`: The asterisk is a wildcard that means "all columns." When you use `*`, you are asking for every piece of information available about the rows in the specified table.
  - `FROM`: This keyword specifies the table from which you want to pull your data.

#### 3. **Querying Data:**
- By constructing a `SELECT` statement, you can query the database to gather specific information without altering any data. This is akin to looking through a filing cabinet but without changing or removing any documents.

### Why It Matters:
Understanding how to use the `SELECT` statement effectively allows you to access and analyze data stored in your database. It is one of the foundational skills in data retrieval and crucial for any data-related tasks.

### Hints:
- **Hint 1:** As you construct your query, consider what specific information you need. Are there particular columns or filters you might want to apply?
- **Hint 2:** Think about the structure of your `users` table. Each user will have multiple fields (like name, email, etc.). Familiarizing yourself with these columns will guide you in retrieving the right information.

By grasping these concepts, you will be equipped to interact with databases more effectively, laying a strong foundation for more complex queries and operations in your future work with SQL.
